We spend more time going through endless videos, photos, sponsored content, or ads than we do individual profiles. In fact, TikTok has determined that it takes about 260 videos to get people addicted to the app `,

Social media celebrities are a real thing. We spend more time on their content because they bring more attention and money to social media companies. As a result, their stuff gets promoted way more than our friends’ profiles. `,

That’s because if we **go viral** on social media, we might become millionaires like all the other social media celebrities. But trying to go viral can be tiring or maybe we become too embarrassed by our low likes or views that we give up on sharing after a time.`,
        p2: `That could be why some of us become “lurkers” – people who share little to nothing on social media but instead lurk on the feed of popular folks or mindlessly react to content with a heart or other emoji. The popular social media apps want us to gobble up popular content because ads instead of expressing ourselves or connecting with our friends and new people in unique ways.`,
